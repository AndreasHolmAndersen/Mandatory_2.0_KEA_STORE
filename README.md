# Mandatory_2.0_KEA_STORE

Hello, this is how to get this one working.

Open up a terminal and cd into both the client and server folder and run the npm i command, to get all of the packages required

Second access the .env_sample and create your own .env file (filling out the empty "fields" from the .env_sample file)

Third make sure you have an instance of mongodb running

Fourth run the seeddb script in the server folder to create your database with the correct info  (tip: try the username as the password)

Now you should be able to run a nodemon server.js in the server folder and a npm run dev in the client folder, 
and the application should run as expected in your browser.

have fun.
